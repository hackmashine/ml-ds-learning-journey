 My path to Data Science and Machine Learning  

Hi! My name is Ilya, and this is my path of learning Data Science and ML.  
This is where I keep all my projects and practices, from the first steps in Python to machine learning models.  

## ðŸ“‚ Content
- **notebooks/** â€” my study notebooks (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, ML).  
- **data/** â€” datasets for analysis.  
- **projects/** â€” mini-projects that show real skills.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies used
- Python (3.10+)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (ML)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Create a Data Scientist portfolio where you can see the growth from zero to real projects.
